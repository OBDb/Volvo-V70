generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1997

    description: "The first-generation Volvo V70 was essentially a significantly facelifted and renamed continuation of the Volvo 850 wagon, introduced in late 1996 as a 1997 model. While sharing the same core platform and mechanical components with the 850, the V70 featured smoother, more rounded exterior styling that moved away from the distinctly boxy design of its predecessor. The interior was also comprehensively redesigned with improved ergonomics, updated materials, and enhanced safety features. Powertrains carried over from the 850, consisting of various five-cylinder engines in naturally aspirated and turbocharged forms, with outputs ranging from approximately 126 to 250 horsepower. The high-performance V70 R featured a turbocharged five-cylinder engine producing up to 250 horsepower, available front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, and unique styling elements. The V70 Cross Country (later XC70) variant introduced in 1997 added increased ground clearance, all-wheel drive, and body cladding for light off-road capability. The first-generation V70 maintained Volvo's reputation for safety innovation, featuring the Side Impact Protection System (SIPS), Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS), and side airbags. This generation helped modernize Volvo's design language while maintaining the brand's core values of safety, durability, and practicality."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The second-generation V70 represented a complete redesign, moving to Volvo's P2 platform shared with the S60 sedan and XC90 SUV. The exterior featured a more refined evolution of Volvo's design language with smoother lines and a more upscale appearance. Interior space increased compared to its predecessor, with improved materials and build quality. Powertrains continued to center around Volvo's five-cylinder engines in various configurations, including naturally aspirated 2.4-liter units and turbocharged variants ranging from light-pressure turbo models to the high-performance T5 and R versions, the latter producing up to 300 horsepower. This generation saw significant advances in safety technology, including available features like Blind Spot Information System (BLIS), adaptive cruise control, and enhanced structural protection. The XC70 cross-country variant continued with increased ground clearance, standard all-wheel drive, and rugged body cladding. A facelift in 2004 updated the styling, interior features, and technology. The second-generation V70 successfully built upon Volvo's wagon heritage with increased refinement, performance, and technology, maintaining its position as a practical yet premium alternative to the growing SUV segment."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The third-generation V70 moved to Ford's EUCD platform shared with the S80 sedan, marking a further step upmarket in size, refinement, and technology. The exterior design featured a more distinctive front end with angled headlights and a sculpted hood, while maintaining the traditional wagon silhouette. The interior offered increased passenger and cargo space, with a floating center console design, premium materials, and advanced technology features. Engine options evolved throughout this generation, beginning with a range of inline-five and inline-six cylinder engines, later transitioning to Volvo's new Drive-E four-cylinder engines focusing on efficiency without sacrificing performance. Safety innovation continued with features like City Safety automatic braking, Driver Alert Control, and Lane Departure Warning. The XC70 cross-country variant again offered increased ground clearance and all-wheel drive capability. A significant update in 2013 refreshed the styling and interior technology while introducing the new family of Drive-E engines. The third-generation V70 was the final iteration of Volvo's mid-size wagon under this nameplate, as it was replaced by the V90 in 2016. Throughout its run, it maintained Volvo's reputation for safety, practicality, and understated luxury, appealing to discerning buyers seeking an alternative to both premium sedans and increasingly popular SUVs."
